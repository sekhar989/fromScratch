# fromScratch

The goal of this repository is to explore fundamental ML algorithms and gain an in-depth understanding about the inner mechanism, by building them from scratch.
A list of algorithms which are explored here are listed below:

- [Decision Stumps](https://github.com/sekhar989/fromScratch/tree/main/Decision%20Stump%20-%20Boosting)
- [K-Means Clustering]()
- [Linear Regression]()
- [Logistic Regression]()
- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]()

The list will be increasing with time..

> *Note: All the algorithms are coded using Python programming language. The codes will be written without keeping the efficiency, in mind because the primary goal i.e. understanding. It is not recommended to use the code in production systems. It is purely for learning and understanding purpose.*
