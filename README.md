# fromScratch

The goal of this repository is to explore fundamental ML algorithms and gain an in-depth understanding about the inner mechanism, by building them from scratch.
A list of algorithms which are explored here are listed below:

- [Decision Stumps]()
- [K-Means Clustering]()
- [Linear Regression]()
- [Logistic Regression]()
- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]()

The list will be increasing with time..

*Note: All the algorithms are coded using Python programming language. I plan to implement the same using other programming languages of interset (e.g. C++, Rust or Node), which will serve as a process of grasping the programming language. The codes will be written keeping the algorithm efficiency i.e.* $Big(O)$ *, in mind but is not recommended to use them in production system. It is purely for learning and understanding purpose.*
